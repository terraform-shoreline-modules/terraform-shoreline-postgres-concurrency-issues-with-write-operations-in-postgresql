### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Concurrency issues with write operations in PostgreSQL.
---

Concurrency issues with write operations occur when multiple users or processes attempt to write to the same database at the same time, leading to race conditions and data inconsistencies. This can cause corruption of data, loss of data, or unexpected behavior in the database. It is important to handle concurrency issues properly to maintain data integrity and ensure that the database is functioning correctly.

### Parameters
```shell
export HOSTNAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export USERNAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export DATABASE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export TABLE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export ID_VALUE="PLACEHOLDER"

export DATABASE_PASSWORD="PLACEHOLDER"

export DATABASE_PORT="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check the number of active connections to the database
```shell
psql -U ${USERNAME} -h ${HOSTNAME} -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"
```

### Check for long running transactions
```shell
psql -U ${USERNAME} -h ${HOSTNAME} -c "SELECT pid, age(clock_timestamp(), query_start), usename, query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE query NOT LIKE '%IDLE%' AND query NOT LIKE '%pg_stat_activity%' AND query NOT LIKE '%SELECT count(*)%' ORDER BY query_start ASC LIMIT 10;"
```

### Check for deadlocks
```shell
psql -U ${USERNAME} -h ${HOSTNAME} -c "SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE NOT granted;"
```

### Check for table locks
```shell
psql -U ${USERNAME} -h ${HOSTNAME} -c "SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE relation IS NOT NULL;"
```

### Check for blocked processes
```shell
psql -U ${USERNAME} -h ${HOSTNAME} -c "SELECT block.pid AS blocked_pid, block.query AS blocked_query, block.mode AS blocked_mode, block.relation::regclass, now() - block.activity_age AS blocked_duration, blocker.pid AS blocking_pid, blocker.query AS blocking_query, blocker.mode AS blocking_mode, now() - blocker.activity_age AS blocking_duration FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks AS block JOIN pg_catalog.pg_locks AS blocker ON block.relation = blocker.relation AND block.pid != blocker.pid WHERE NOT block.granted;"
```

### Check for slow queries
```shell
psql -U ${USERNAME} -h ${HOSTNAME} -c "SELECT query, (now() - query_start) AS duration FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state='active' AND now() - query_start > INTERVAL '1 minute';"
```

### Multiple users or processes are attempting to write to the same database table simultaneously.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set variables

database=${DATABASE_NAME}

table=${TABLE_NAME}



# Check for active write operations

active_writes=$(psql -d $database -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE query LIKE '%INSERT INTO $table%' OR query LIKE '%UPDATE $table%' OR query LIKE '%DELETE FROM $table%'")



# Check for locks on the table

table_locks=$(psql -d $database -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_locks WHERE relation::regclass = '$table'::regclass")



# Check for blocked processes

blocked_processes=$(psql -d $database -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE waiting='t'")



# Output results

echo "Active write operations: $active_writes"

echo "Table locks: $table_locks"

echo "Blocked processes: $blocked_processes"


```

## Repair

### Use PostgreSQL's built-in locking mechanisms, such as row-level locks or advisory locks, to prevent multiple processes from writing to the same data at the same time.
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash



# Define variables

database=${DATABASE_NAME}

table=${TABLE_NAME}

id=${ID_VALUE}



# Connect to PostgreSQL

psql -d $database -c "BEGIN; LOCK TABLE $table IN ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE; UPDATE $table SET column = value WHERE id = $id; COMMIT;"


```
